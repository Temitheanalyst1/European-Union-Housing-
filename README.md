# 💬 Europe’s Housing Story  What the Data Tell Us
## 🏠 Overview

## The European housing market tells a story that goes far beyond numbers  it’s a reflection of people, affordability, and social change.

This project explores housing data across Europe using Power BI, focusing on the House Price Index (2015 = 100) and the Price-to-Income Ratio to reveal how affordability and housing dynamics have evolved over time.

Through this analysis, I aim to highlight how data visualization can humanize complex economic patterns.,  turning statistics into stories about real lives.

### 📊 Key Insights

####  Romania’s turnaround:
In 2007, Romania had the highest house price-to-income ratio in Europe. Since 2008, however, it has moved in the opposite direction, and by 2024 now holds the lowest ratio  a remarkable improvement in affordability and access to housing.

#### Portugal’s rise:
Portugal now stands as the most expensive housing market relative to income, surpassing the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Austria.

#### Turkey’s surge (outside official ratio dataset):
Despite not being included in the official Eurostat price-to-income ratio dataset, Turkey’s market shows the fastest appreciation since 2015 (+15.9% annually) and an index over 540% higher than in 2015 (Q3 2024)  reflecting intense housing demand and inflationary pressure.
